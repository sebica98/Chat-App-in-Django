# Chat-App-in-Django
This is a chat application developed with django. 
To test the server run in terminal python manage.py runserver.
Then go to the default address http://127.0.0.1:8000/, register with an account, login and start chatting.
Please make sure you have the requirements.txt packages installed in order to execute it and that the migrations are up to date.
After logging in each user can edit his profile and upload a photo. It will be saved under media/images directory and will be visible when the user writes a message.
I also added the option to view each user profile when you click on his name in the chat. (see picture 2)
